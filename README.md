## üåü Features :

6 Vulnerability Detection Tests:

- SQL Injection detection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) detection
- HTTPS/SSL verification
- Directory Traversal detection
- Command Injection detection
- Open Redirect detection

## üîß How It Works :

Vulnerability Detection Methods

### 1. SQL Injection

Searches for common SQL injection patterns: ', ", OR 1=1, UNION SELECT
Checks URL parameters for suspicious SQL syntax

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Detects script tags, JavaScript protocols, event handlers
Patterns: <script>, javascript:, onerror=, onload=

### 3. HTTPS/SSL Check

Verifies if URL uses HTTPS protocol
Flags HTTP connections as medium severity

### 4. Directory Traversal

Looks for path traversal patterns: ../, ..\\, %2e%2e
Identifies attempts to access parent directories

### 5. Command Injection

Detects shell command characters: |, ;, &, `, $
Flags potential OS command injection attempts

### 6. Open Redirect

Searches for redirect parameters: redirect=, url=, next=
Identifies potential open redirect vulnerabilities
